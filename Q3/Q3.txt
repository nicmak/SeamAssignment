Question 3:

1. Edge Cases:

-Test out extreme cases where the software system would sent out emails at times close to 24 hours before scheduled time.
 i.e. send out at either 23 Hours, 59 Minutes, 59 seconds... or 24 hours and 1 second

2. Sending emails to Non-existing/Invalid Email Addresses

-Test to see how the system responds when sending an email that is invalid or non-existant...would it try to keep sending it?
- As well to check if sent, login with SMTP to check if email successfully received by user.
